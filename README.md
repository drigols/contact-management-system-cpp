## Project Overview

 - **Features:**
   - **The project has a CLI with 7 options:**
     - **1. Display all contacts**
       - This feature shows all contacts stored in the [data/contacts.txt](./data/contacts.txt).
       - The contacts are stored in the format: *"contactName,phoneNumber"*
     - **2. Add new contact**
       - This feature adds a new contact to [data/contacts.txt](./data/contacts.txt).
       - The feature receives:
         - The contact name.
         - The contact phone number.
     - **3. Search telephone No.**
       - This feature receives a phone number by the user and search in [data/contacts.txt](./data/contacts.txt).
       - However, this feature removes *special characters* and *white spaces*. For example, if the user pass:
         - `[83]123456789`, `83 123456789`, `(83) 123456789` the final result always will be `"83123456789"`.
     - **4. Search person name**
       - This feature receives a name from the user and searches in [data/contacts.txt](./data/contacts.txt).
       - If the user passes the capital name or uppercase the method converts lowercase before comparing. For example:
         - `Rodrigo Leite`, `rodrigo Leite`, `RODIRGO LEITE` the final result always will be `"rodrigo leite"`.
       - Also, if the user passes a special character it will be removed before the search. For example:
         - `Jo√£o` to `joao`.
     - **5. Update contact**
       - This feature opens another menu and asks the user if he wishes to modify a contact by *name* or *phone number*:
         - If you wish to modify your contact name enter one (1)
         - If you wish to modify your phone number enter two (2)
         - If you wish to back to the main menu enter three (3)
     - **6. Delete contact**
       - This feature removes a contact from [data/contacts.txt](./data/contacts.txt).
       - This feature also opens another menu and asks the user if he wishes to delete a contact by *name* or *phone number*:
         - If you wish to delete a contact by name enter one (1)
         - If you wish to delete a contact by phone number enter two (2)
         - If you wish to back to the main menu enter three (3)
     - **7. Exit**
       - Finally, this option closes the CLI (program).
 - **Source code:**
   - **contact.(h and cpp):**
     - The *Contact class* provides methods to manage your contacts.
   - **cli.(h and cpp):**
     - The CLI class provides an interface to manage you Contact information.
